command used:
diff passwords.old passwords.new
explanation:
This level contains two files: passwords.old and passwords.new.
Both files are very similar, but only one line is different between them.
The diff command compares the two files line by line and shows the differences.
The line that appears only in passwords.new is the password for the next level.
