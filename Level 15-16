explanation:
This level is similar to the previous one, but the service on port 30001 uses SSL/TLS encryption.
openssl s_client is used to establish a secure connection to the service.
After the connection is established, you manually paste the current password into the session.
If the password is correct, the server responds with the password for the next level.
