command used:
ls
git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo
cd repo
cat README.md
git log
git show <commit_id>
explanation:
After cloning the Git repository, the README.md file does not show the password directly.
The password was removed in a later commit.
By checking the Git history using git log, you can see previous commits.
Using git show on an older commit reveals the file content before the password was removed.
That earlier version contains the password for the next level.
