./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
explanation:
This level provides a special binary called bandit20-do.
This program runs commands as the user bandit20, even though you are logged in as bandit19.
Executing bandit20-do with the cat command allows you to read /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20,
which is normally accessible only by bandit20.
The output is the password for the next level.
