explanation:
This level also uses a cron job that runs automatically.
By inspecting /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit23, you can see which script is executed.
The script /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh dynamically generates the filename that contains the password, based on the username.
Understanding how the script constructs the filename allows you to locate and read the correct file.
That file contains the password for the next level.
