explanation:
When you log in, you are placed inside a restricted shell that only accepts uppercase commands.
However, $0 represents the name of the current shell.
Running $0 launches a normal interactive shell, bypassing the restriction.
Once in the normal shell, you can verify your user and directly read the final password file.
