Login:
ssh bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
password to login:
iCi86ttT4KSNe1armKiwbQNmB3YJP3q4
command used:
ls
ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost
(then resize terminal and run :set shell=/bin/bash inside more)
explanation:
This level provides a private SSH key (bandit26.sshkey) but logging in normally drops you into a restricted environment.
The login uses the more command, which limits interaction.
By resizing the terminal window to make more active and accessing its command mode,
you can escape to a shell by setting the shell to /bin/bash.
This gives you a normal shell as bandit26, allowing access to the password for the next level.
