command used:
cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
explanation:
This level uses a cron job that executes a script as bandit24.
The cron configuration file shows which script is being run automatically.
By reading the script, you can see that it executes and deletes scripts placed in a specific temporary directory.
By creating your own script in that directory which reads /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24,
the cron job will execute it with bandit24’s permissions and reveal the password for the next level.
