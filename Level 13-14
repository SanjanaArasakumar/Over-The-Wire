command used:
ls
cp sshkey.private mykey
chmod 600 mykey
ssh -i mykey bandit14@localhost
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
explanation:
Instead of a password, this level provides a private SSH key (sshkey.private).
SSH requires private keys to have strict permissions, so the key is copied to a new file and restricted using chmod 600.
The ssh -i option tells SSH to authenticate using this private key.
Logging in as bandit14 on localhost allows access to the protected password file.
Reading /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 reveals the password for the next level.
