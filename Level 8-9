command used:
sort data.txt | uniq -u
explanation:
The file data.txt contains many duplicate lines, but only one line occurs exactly once.
The sort command arranges all lines so duplicates are grouped together.
The uniq -u command then prints only the line that is unique.
That unique line is the password for the next level.
