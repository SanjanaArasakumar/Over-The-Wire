command used:
nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790
(then paste the current password and press Enter)
explanation:
In this level, several services are running on ports between 31000 and 32000, but only one uses SSL and accepts the correct password.
nmap is used to scan the port range and identify which ports are open.
Among the open ports, the SSL-enabled service is identified.
openssl s_client is then used to securely connect to that port.
After sending the correct password, the service responds with a private SSH key for the next level.
