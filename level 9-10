command used:
strings data.txt | grep "="
explanation:
The file data.txt contains mostly non-human-readable (binary) data.
The strings command extracts readable text from binary files.
Among the readable strings, the password is the one that contains the character =.
Using grep "=" filters and displays that line, which contains the password for the next level.
