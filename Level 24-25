command used:
nc localhost 30002
(then repeatedly send password + PIN combinations)
Example:
echo "password 0000" | nc localhost 30002
explanation:
A service is running on port 30002 that requires the correct password and a 4‑digit PIN.
The password is already known, but the PIN must be brute‑forced.
Using nc (netcat), you can send combinations of the password and different PIN values.
When the correct PIN is sent, the service responds with the password for the next level.
password for next level:
