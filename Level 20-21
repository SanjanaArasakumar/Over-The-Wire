command used:
echo "<current_password>" | nc -l -p 12345
./suconnect 12345
explanation:
This level includes a program called suconnect that connects to a specified port on localhost.
First, nc (netcat) is used to listen on a local port and send the current password when a connection is made.
Then suconnect connects to that port and reads the password.
If the correct password is received, suconnect responds with the password for the next level.
